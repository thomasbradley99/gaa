REASONING: The clip shows a period of continuous open play. A team in blue jerseys is attacking the goal on the left side of the screen. The play culminates in a shot or pass that goes wide of the goalpost near the end of the clip. This action would trigger a kickout, but the kickout itself (the goalkeeper taking the kick) does not occur within the 15-second timeframe of this video. The players are still in their attacking/defensive formations from open play and have not begun to reposition for the restart.
