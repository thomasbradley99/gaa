ANALYSIS:
KICKOUT: NO
CONFIDENCE: 10
HALF: first_half
CLIP_TIME: 00:00
DETECTIONS: ['player', 'ball', 'pitch', 'goalpost']
MISSED_DETECTIONS: ['referee']

REASONING: The clip shows teams warming up before a match. There are multiple balls on the field, and players are casually kicking them around in drills. There is no structured play, no referee, and no goalkeeper performing the specific sequence of actions required for a kickout. The scene is clearly a pre-game warm-up, not an official game restart.
