COMMENTARY:
The blue team works the ball dangerously close to the goal, creating a frantic scramble right in front of the posts as players from both sides converge on the loose ball. The referee spots an infringement and blows the whistle at 7.1 seconds, awarding a free out to the red and black team. This allows the defenders to reset and clear the danger.
