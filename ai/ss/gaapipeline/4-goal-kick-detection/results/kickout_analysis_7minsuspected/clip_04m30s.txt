CLIP_TIME: 04:30
DETECTIONS: [player, ball, pitch, goalpost]
MISSED_DETECTIONS: [goalkeeper, referee]

REASONING: The video shows a continuous period of open play in the midfield. The ball is passed between several players from both teams. There is no stoppage of play, and a goalkeeper does not perform a kick from their designated area to restart the game. The actions are characteristic of normal gameplay, not a set-piece kickout.
