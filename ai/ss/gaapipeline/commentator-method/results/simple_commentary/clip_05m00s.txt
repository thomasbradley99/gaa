COMMENTARY:
The blue team works the ball forward on the attack. A long, high ball is floated in towards the goalmouth, creating a dangerous situation for the red and black defence. Players from both sides converge under the dropping ball, and it breaks loose in a scramble right in front of the posts, with several players going to ground in the battle for possession.
