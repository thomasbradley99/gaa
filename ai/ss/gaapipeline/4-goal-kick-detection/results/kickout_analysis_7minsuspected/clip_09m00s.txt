DETECTIONS: [player, ball, grass, goalpost]
MISSED_DETECTIONS: [referee, goalkeeper]

REASONING: The clip depicts a period of open play. At the start of the clip, a player in a blue jersey kicks the ball from a central midfield position. This action is a long pass or a shot on goal from play, not a restart taken by a goalkeeper from their designated area. The subsequent action involves multiple players from both teams running towards the landing zone to contest for possession, which is characteristic of in-play action rather than a set-piece kickout. No goalkeeper is observed taking the kick.
