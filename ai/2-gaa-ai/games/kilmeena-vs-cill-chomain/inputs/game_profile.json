  "notes": "Team Identification:\n- Team A (White) is identified by its consistent 'White' jersey and 'White' keeper mentions.\n- Team B is identified as the primary opponent, with jersey descriptions varying between 'Dark', 'Black', 'Dark Blue', and 'Dark Brown/Black'. 'Dark Blue' is chosen as the representative jersey color due to its frequency in attacking actions. The opponent keeper is consistently described as 'Black'.\n\nMatch Times:\n- Start: 0s (first IN-PLAY is at 0s, within the 60s threshold).\n- Half Time: 2040s (first HALFTIME state).\n- Second Half Start: 2760s (first IN-PLAY for the main teams 'Dark vs White' after the HALFTIME and WARMUP periods).\n- End: 4920s (last IN-PLAY state).\n\nAttacking Directions - Critical Analysis:\n\n**First Half (0s - 2040s):**\n- **Field Orientation (Tier 2 - Keeper Frames):**\n  - 60s: Black keeper LEFT, White keeper RIGHT. (Implies Team B defends LEFT, Team A defends RIGHT)\n  - 270s: Dark Blue keeper LEFT, White keeper RIGHT. (Implies Team B defends LEFT, Team A defends RIGHT)\n  - (90s: White keeper LEFT, Black keeper RIGHT. This frame is inconsistent with the majority, suggesting a camera perspective change or temporary field orientation shift.)\n  - **Conclusion for 1st Half Orientation:** Based on the majority of Tier 2 keeper frames (2 out of 3), Team A (White) attacks LEFT (right-to-left), and Team B (Dark Blue) attacks RIGHT (left-to-right).\n\n- **Team A (White) attacking R-L (toward LEFT goal):**\n  - Consistent frames: 480s (White attacking toward LEFT goal), 1860s (White attacking toward LEFT goal). (2 instances)\n  - Inconsistent frames (attacking RIGHT goal, interpreted as camera perspective changes): 1170s, 1200s, 1530s, 1560s. (4 instances)\n\n- **Team B (Dark Blue) attacking L-R (toward RIGHT goal):**\n  - Consistent frames: 120s, 150s, 600s, 840s, 1050s, 1080s, 1380s, 1470s, 1500s, 1680s, 1740s, 1770s, 1890s (all attacking toward RIGHT goal/area). (13 instances)\n  - Inconsistent frames (attacking LEFT goal, interpreted as camera perspective changes): 510s, 630s, 900s, 1020s, 1140s, 1950s. (6 instances)\n\n**Second Half (2760s - 4920s):**\n- **Field Orientation (Tier 2 - Keeper Frames):**\n  - 2940s: White keeper LEFT, Black keeper RIGHT. (Implies Team A defends LEFT, Team B defends RIGHT)\n  - 3180s: White keeper LEFT, Black keeper RIGHT. (Implies Team A defends LEFT, Team B defends RIGHT)\n  - 3900s: Dark Blue keeper RIGHT, White keeper LEFT. (Implies Team B defends RIGHT, Team A defends LEFT, consistent with above)\n  - 4560s: White keeper LEFT, Dark Blue keeper RIGHT. (Implies Team A defends LEFT, Team B defends RIGHT)\n  - **Conclusion for 2nd Half Orientation:** All 4 Tier 2 keeper frames consistently indicate Team A (White) attacks RIGHT (left-to-right), and Team B (Dark Blue) attacks LEFT (right-to-left).\n\n- **Team A (White) attacking L-R (toward RIGHT goal):**\n  - Consistent frames: 3030s, 3330s, 3660s (all attacking toward RIGHT goal). (3 instances)\n  - Inconsistent frames: None.\n\n- **Team B (Dark Blue) attacking R-L (toward LEFT goal):**\n  - Consistent frames: 2970s, 3120s, 3150s, 3300s (all attacking toward LEFT goal/area). (4 instances)\n  - Inconsistent frames (attacking RIGHT goal, interpreted as camera perspective changes): 3060s, 3210s, 3240s, 3420s, 3570s, 3600s, 3690s, 3720s, 3810s, 3870s, 3930s, 4230s, 4290s, 4470s. (14 instances)\n\n**Validation:**\n- The chosen attacking directions (Team A R-L, Team B L-R in 1st half; Team A L-R, Team B R-L in 2nd half) satisfy the rules that teams must attack opposite directions in the same half and switch directions at halftime. This interpretation prioritizes the consistent field orientation provided by Tier 2 keeper frames to resolve ambiguities and apparent contradictions in Tier 1 attacking action descriptions, which are likely influenced by changing camera perspectives.\n\n\u26a0\ufe0f VERIFY: Attack directions are AI-inferred and may be incorrect. Watch first kickoff to confirm which team attacks which direction.",
