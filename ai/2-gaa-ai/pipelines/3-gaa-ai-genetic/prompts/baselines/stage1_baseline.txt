**CLIP TIMING:**
This clip shows {clip_start_time} to {clip_end_time}.

**YOUR TASK:**
First understand WHERE and WHAT'S HAPPENING, then describe SPECIFIC EVENTS.

**STEP 1: UNDERSTAND THE CONTEXT**
- WHERE on pitch: Near goal / Attacking area / Midfield / Defensive area
- WHAT'S HAPPENING: Are teams passing around? Attacking? Defending? Contesting ball?

**STEP 2: DETECT THESE EVENTS (be selective - don't over-report):**

1. **SHOTS** - Clear scoring attempts ONLY:
   - ⚠️ Only report if you SEE the actual shot/kick toward goal
   - Don't report "attempts" or "attacks" - must see the shot
   - WHO shoots, WHERE from, OUTCOME (Point/Goal/Wide/Saved)
   - Example: "{example_mid_time} - White shoots from 25m center - POINT scored"

2. **KICKOUTS** - Goalkeeper restarts (be selective):
   - ⚠️ Don't report EVERY kickout - only if significant or clearly visible
   - After a score, many kickouts are routine - skip if nothing notable
   - WHO kicks, DISTANCE (Long/Mid/Short), DIRECTION (Left/Centre/Right), OUTCOME (Won/Lost)
   - Example: "{clip_start_time} - Black keeper kicks out LONG to CENTRE, White WINS in midfield"

3. **FOULS** - Look for CLEAR SIGNS:
   - 🚩 Referee arm raised / signaling
   - 🚩 Play STOPS suddenly (ball dead, players waiting)
   - 🚩 Players clustered around stoppage
   - 🚩 Player on ground after contact
   - 🔊 Whistle heard (if audible)
   - DESCRIBE: Which team fouled (conceded), where it happened (near goal = scoreable)
   - Example: "{clip_end_time} - Play stops, Black fouls White near goal - SCOREABLE free awarded"
   - Example: "{example_mid_time} - White fouls Black in midfield - free awarded"

4. **TURNOVERS** - VERY RARE, strict criteria:
   - ONLY if: Ball clearly DROPPED / Pass INTERCEPTED mid-flight / Clean TACKLE causes loss
   - Don't report normal ball contests or possession changes
   - Example: "{example_mid_time} - White player DROPS ball, Black recovers"

**Important:**
- Use absolute timestamps like {clip_start_time} (NOT 0:05)
- Include WHERE events happen (near goal, midfield, attacking area, etc.)
- Only describe KEY events you're CONFIDENT about
