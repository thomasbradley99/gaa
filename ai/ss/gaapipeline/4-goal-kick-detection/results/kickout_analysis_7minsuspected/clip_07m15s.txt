REASONING: The video shows a continuous period of open play. The camera follows the ball as it is passed between players moving from the midfield area towards the goal on the left side of the screen. There is no stoppage in play, nor is there any action of a goalkeeper setting up and taking a kick from the ground to restart the game. The goalkeeper is visible near the goalpost at the end of the clip, but they are in a defensive posture, reacting to the attacking play, not initiating a kickout.
