ANALYSIS:
KICKOUT: NO
CONFIDENCE: 10
HALF: first_half
CLIP_TIME: 07:30

REASONING: The clip shows continuous open play within the attacking half of the field. There is no trigger event (like a shot going wide) or stoppage in play. The ball is actively being passed between players. The high kick shown is a pass from an outfield player into the forward line, not a structured restart by a goalkeeper from the 20-meter line. All the required elements of an official GAA kickout are absent.
