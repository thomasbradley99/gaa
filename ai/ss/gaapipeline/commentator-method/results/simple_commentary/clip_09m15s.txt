COMMENTARY:
The red team works the ball forward, and a kick from the left wing sails over the bar for a point. Following the score, the blue team goalkeeper in the white jersey prepares to restart the play. At 9.1 seconds, he strikes the ball, taking a short kickout to a teammate on the right flank who now looks to build an attack from deep.
