ANALYSIS:
KICKOUT: NO
CONFIDENCE: 10
HALF: first_half
CLIP_TIME: 02:45
DETECTIONS: ['player', 'ball', 'pitch', 'goalpost']
MISSED_DETECTIONS: ['goalkeeper', 'referee']

REASONING: The clip shows a continuous phase of open play. The ball is in the middle of the field and is being passed between players from both teams. There is no stoppage in play, no referee signal, and no action originating from a goalkeeper at either end of the pitch that would indicate a kickout. The players are actively contesting possession, which is characteristic of open play, not the set-piece restart of a kickout.
