COMMENTARY:
The blue team's goalkeeper, in the orange jersey, sets up for the kickout. At 5.0 seconds, he makes contact, driving the ball high and long towards the midfield. Players from both sides converge, and the ball breaks down into a scrum on the ground. The team in red and black jerseys wins the contested possession and begins to move the ball forward.
