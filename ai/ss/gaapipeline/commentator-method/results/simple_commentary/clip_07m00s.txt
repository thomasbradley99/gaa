COMMENTARY:
The blue team works the ball forward into the attacking half, and a player takes a shot that sails wide of the posts. Play restarts with the red team goalkeeper, who takes the kickout. At 12.8 seconds, he strikes the ball with his right foot, driving it low and out towards the left wing for his players to contest.
