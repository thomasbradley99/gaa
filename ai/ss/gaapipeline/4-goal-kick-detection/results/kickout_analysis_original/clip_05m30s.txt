REASONING: The trigger event, which is the shot on goal going wide or over the bar, is not visible in this clip. The video starts after the play has already stopped and the teams are setting up for a restart. While the subsequent actions (players clearing the area, goalkeeper placing the ball on the ground, and taking a long kick) are consistent with a kickout, the mandatory requirement of witnessing the preceding trigger event is not met. Without seeing the ball go out of play, it's impossible to definitively distinguish an official kickout from a free kick being taken from a similar position.
