COMMENTARY:
Play restarts with a kickout from the red team goalkeeper in the red and black jersey. After assessing his options, he begins his run-up. At 9.8 seconds, he makes contact with the ball, driving a high kick towards the right-hand side of the field where players from both sides are positioning themselves to contest possession.
