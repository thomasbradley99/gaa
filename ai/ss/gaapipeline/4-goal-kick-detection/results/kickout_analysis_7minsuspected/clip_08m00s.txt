CLIP_TIME: 08:00
DETECTIONS: [player, ball, goalpost, pitch]
MISSED_DETECTIONS: [referee]

REASONING: The stoppage in play is due to a foul, not a score or a wide ball. A referee's whistle is heard, and players from the team in red and black are awarded a free kick from within their small rectangle. A regular player, not the goalkeeper (who is visible in an orange jersey on the goal line), is the one to restart play. This is a defensive free kick, not a kickout.
