REASONING: The clip depicts continuous open play. It begins with a player in blue being tackled near the goal, leading to a loose ball. The subsequent action involves multiple players from both teams contesting for possession of the ball in the same area of the pitch. There is no stoppage in play, no reset of player positions, and no goalkeeper initiating a kickout from their designated area. The action is a fluid part of the game, not a restart.
