  "notes": "Team A's jersey color is predominantly 'Red', sometimes appearing as 'Red/Orange' or 'Red/Maroon'. Team B's jersey color is predominantly 'White/Blue', with variations including 'White', 'Blue', 'Light Blue', or 'White/Light Blue'. Keeper colors were determined by the most frequent explicit mentions for each team. Attacking directions for the 2nd half assume a standard switch of ends at halftime, despite some conflicting or ambiguous keeper position descriptions in the frame data.",
