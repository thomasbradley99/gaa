CLIP_TIME: 05:00

REASONING: The clip shows continuous open play with an attacking move towards the goal. There is no trigger event (like a shot going wide), no stoppage of play, and no setup for a kickout. Players are converging on the goal, not clearing the area for a restart from the 20-meter line. This is a standard passage of attacking play, culminating in a scramble in front of the goal.
