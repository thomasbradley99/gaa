COMMENTARY:
The blue team works the ball in close to the goal, and a player gets a shot off under pressure. The kick is good, and the umpire raises the white flag at the 5-second mark to signal a point. The players now jog back into position as the red team's goalkeeper in yellow prepares for the kickout.
