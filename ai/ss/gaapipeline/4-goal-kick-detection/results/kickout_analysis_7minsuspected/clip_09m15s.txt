The referee confirms the score. In response, players from both teams begin to move upfield, clearing the area for the restart. The Team A goalkeeper, in a white jersey, collects the ball, walks forward from his goal, and places the ball down to take the kickout. The clip concludes just before he makes contact with the ball.
