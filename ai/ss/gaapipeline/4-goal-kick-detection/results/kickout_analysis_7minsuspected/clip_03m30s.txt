DETECTIONS: [player, ball, goalpost, referee, crowd, pitch]
MISSED_DETECTIONS: []

REASONING: The kick that occurs during this clip is a free kick taken by an outfield player, not a kickout performed by a goalkeeper. At 00:04, the referee blows the whistle and signals for a free kick in the middle of the field. An outfield player in a blue jersey then takes this kick from the ground at 00:08. This action does not align with the definition of a kickout, which must be taken by the goalkeeper from within their own 20-meter area.
