ANALYSIS:
KICKOUT: NO
CONFIDENCE: 10
HALF: first_half
CLIP_TIME: 07:15

REASONING: The video shows a period of continuous open play. There is no trigger event (such as a shot going wide or over the bar) that would lead to a kickout. The ball is being passed between players as one team moves up the field in an attack. This is not a structured restart from a stationary ball by the goalkeeper.
