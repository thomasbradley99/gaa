ANALYSIS:
KICKOUT: NO
CONFIDENCE: 10
HALF: first_half
CLIP_TIME: 09:15

REASONING: The clip shows continuous play. Although there is a shot on goal at the beginning, the subsequent action is not a kickout. A whistle is heard, and what appears to be a score is signaled, but there is no stoppage of play for a kickout. Players remain clustered in the attacking half, and no goalkeeper is seen setting up for or taking a kick from the 20-meter line. The play continues with players passing the ball.
