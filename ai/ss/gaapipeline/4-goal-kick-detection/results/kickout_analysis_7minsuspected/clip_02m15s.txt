REASONING: The clip begins with the ball in open play in the midfield. Play is stopped at 00:08 by the referee's whistle due to a foul, not because the ball went out of play for a score or a wide. The referee signals for a free kick to the team in blue jerseys. A kickout is a specific restart performed by a goalkeeper from their own 20-meter line, which does not occur here.
