ANALYSIS:
KICKOUT: NO
CONFIDENCE: 10
HALF: first_half
CLIP_TIME: 03:45

REASONING: The clip shows a period of open play where players are jogging and repositioning in the middle of the field. There is no trigger event (such as a shot going wide) that would necessitate a kickout. The goalkeeper is not seen setting up, there is no ball placed on the 20-meter line, and no kick is taken. The scene lacks all the fundamental elements of an official GAA kickout sequence.
