ANALYSIS:
KICKOUT: NO
CONFIDENCE: 10
HALF: first_half
CLIP_TIME: 01:15

REASONING: The clip shows continuous, active play in the midfield area. There is no trigger event, such as a shot going wide or over the bar, that would precede a kickout. The ball is turned over during play, and a foul is committed, resulting in a free kick, not a kickout. None of the required elements of an official kickout (complete stoppage, area clearance, ball placement on the ground, structured kick from the 20m line) are present.
