ANALYSIS:
KICKOUT: NO
CONFIDENCE: 10
HALF: first_half
CLIP_TIME: 09:45

REASONING: The video shows continuous open play with tackles and turnovers near the goal. There is no stoppage of play, no referee signal, no clearing of the 20-meter area, and no structured kick from a stationary ball by the goalkeeper. This is a normal phase of the match, not an official kickout.
