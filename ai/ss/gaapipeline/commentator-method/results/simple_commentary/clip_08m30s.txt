COMMENTARY:
The blue team's goalkeeper in yellow gets play restarted, striking the ball from his hands at 0.4 seconds. The kick is high and short, landing perilously in front of his own goal where it's immediately contested. A player from the red and black team reacts quickest in the scramble, forcing the ball into the back of the net for a goal, which is confirmed by the umpire's green flag.
