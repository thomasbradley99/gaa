COMMENTARY:
The ball is kicked long into the middle of the park and claimed by a player in the blue and white jersey. He's immediately swarmed by red and black jerseys, and a robust tackle brings him to the ground. After a brief scramble for the loose ball, the referee blows the whistle and awards a free kick to the blue team.
