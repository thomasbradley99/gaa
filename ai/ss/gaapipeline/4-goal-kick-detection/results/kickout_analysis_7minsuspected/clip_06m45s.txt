REASONING: The clip shows a period of open play in the midfield. A high ball is in the air and is subsequently caught by a player in a blue jersey. The action occurs far from either goalpost, with numerous players from both teams converging on the ball. This is characteristic of a contest for possession during play, not a restart taken by a goalkeeper from their goal area. No goalkeeper is seen kicking the ball.
