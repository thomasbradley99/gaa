ANALYSIS:
KICKOUT: NO
CONFIDENCE: 10
HALF: first_half
CLIP_TIME: 00:45

REASONING: The clip shows a general view of the pitch during a stoppage in play. No specific action, such as a kickout, takes place. Players are walking into position, but there is no goalkeeper preparing to kick the ball from the 20-meter line, nor is there a trigger event (like a shot going wide) visible in the clip. An outfield player is holding the ball near midfield, which is inconsistent with a kickout sequence.
