COMMENTARY:
The blue team goalkeeper in the yellow jersey prepares for the kickout, looking for options downfield. After a short run-up, he makes contact with the ball at 13.6 seconds, sending a high, floating kick towards the center of the pitch. Players from both the red and blue teams are positioned under it, ready to compete for possession.
