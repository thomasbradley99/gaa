ANALYSIS:
KICKOUT: NO
CONFIDENCE: 10
HALF: first_half
CLIP_TIME: 02:00

REASONING: The video shows continuous open play. There is no trigger event, such as a shot going wide, and no subsequent stoppage of play. The clip begins with a player in a blue jersey running with the ball and the game proceeds without interruption. The ball is passed between players and is never placed on the ground by a goalkeeper for a structured restart from the 20m line. This is a standard passage of play, not a kickout.
