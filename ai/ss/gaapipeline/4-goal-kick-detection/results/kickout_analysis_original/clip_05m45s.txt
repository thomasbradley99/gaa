ANALYSIS:
KICKOUT: NO
CONFIDENCE: 2
HALF: first_half
CLIP_TIME: 05:45

REASONING: The critical trigger event (a shot going wide or over the bar) is not visible in this clip. The footage begins after play has already stopped, with the goalkeeper preparing to kick the ball. Without seeing what caused the stoppage, I cannot definitively confirm this is an official kickout as per the strict criteria. It could be a free kick taken from the 20-meter line. Furthermore, the clip ends before the ball lands, so the aerial contest and possession outcome cannot be verified.
