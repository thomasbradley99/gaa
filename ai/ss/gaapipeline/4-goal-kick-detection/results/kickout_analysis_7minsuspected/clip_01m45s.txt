ANALYSIS:
KICKOUT: NO
CONFIDENCE: 10
HALF: first_half
CLIP_TIME: 01:45
DETECTIONS: [player, ball, pitch]
MISSED_DETECTIONS: [goalkeeper, goalpost, referee]

REASONING: The clip shows a period of continuous open play. The ball is being passed between players in the midfield area as one team builds an attack. There is no stoppage in play, no referee signal, and no goalkeeper is seen preparing for or taking a kick from in front of the goal. The player movements are characteristic of active play rather than the strategic repositioning seen during a kickout.
