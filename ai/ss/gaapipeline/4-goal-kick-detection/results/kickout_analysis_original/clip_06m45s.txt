ANALYSIS:
KICKOUT: NO
CONFIDENCE: 10
HALF: first_half
CLIP_TIME: 06:45

REASONING: The clip begins mid-play with the ball already in the air. There is no visible trigger event (e.g., a shot going wide or over the bar), no stoppage of play, and no footage of a goalkeeper setting up and taking a kick from a stationary ball on the 20-meter line. The action shown is consistent with a pass or a clearance during a continuous phase of play, not a formal kickout restart.
