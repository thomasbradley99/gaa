ANALYSIS:
KICKOUT: NO
CONFIDENCE: 10
HALF: first_half
CLIP_TIME: 00:15
DETECTIONS: [player, ball, pitch, goalpost, crowd]
MISSED_DETECTIONS: [referee, goalkeeper]

REASONING: The clip shows players casually warming up or participating in a light training drill in the middle of the field. There is no indication of a stoppage in play or a restart. No player is identifiable as a goalkeeper preparing for a kickout near the goalpost. The play is continuous and lacks the organized structure of a formal kickout sequence.
