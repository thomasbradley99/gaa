REASONING: The video clip shows a period of open play in the middle of the field. Players are not positioned for a restart, and there is no goalkeeper visible preparing to take a kickout from the goal area. The action is consistent with the teams setting up for the next phase of play after a stoppage, but not an official kickout from the goalkeeper.
