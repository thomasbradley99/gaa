COMMENTARY:
The red team goalkeeper in the yellow jersey takes the kickout, striking the ball at 1.8 seconds and sending it high towards the right side of the field. The player in the blue number 10 jersey comes out to claim it cleanly under pressure. He immediately turns and lays it off to a teammate, launching a blue team attack as they move the ball through the middle.
