ANALYSIS:
KICKOUT: NO
CONFIDENCE: 10
HALF: first_half
CLIP_TIME: 04:00

REASONING: The clip shows a point being scored from what appears to be a free kick. The kick is taken by an outfield player in a dark jersey, not the goalkeeper from the 20m line. Following the score, there is a stoppage in play, but the subsequent kickout from the opposing goalkeeper is not shown within this 15-second segment. The main action is the successful shot for a point, not a restart via a kickout.
