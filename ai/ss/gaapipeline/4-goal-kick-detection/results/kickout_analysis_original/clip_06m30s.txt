ANALYSIS:
KICKOUT: NO
CONFIDENCE: 10
HALF: first_half
CLIP_TIME: 06:30

REASONING: The clip shows continuous, active play. A player kicks the ball from their hands as a long pass towards the goal. There is no stoppage of play, no clearing of the 20-meter area, and the ball is not placed on the ground for a structured kickout by the goalkeeper. This is a standard passage of play, not a restart.
