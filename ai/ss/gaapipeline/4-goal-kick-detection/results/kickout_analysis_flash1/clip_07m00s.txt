CLIP_TIME: 07:00
DETECTIONS: ['player', 'ball', 'pitch', 'goalpost', 'grass']
MISSED_DETECTIONS: ['goalkeeper', 'referee']
REASONING: The game is underway with play concentrated in the middle of the pitch. I don't see the ball going out of play, a referee signalling, a goalkeeper positioning the ball, or any other signs of a kickout sequence occurring in this clip.
