REASONING: The clip shows a period of continuous open play. The team in red and black are on the attack and move the ball up the field, culminating in a long-range kick that goes over the crossbar for a point. This action would trigger a kickout, but the clip ends as the point is scored. The actual kickout does not take place within this 15-second window.
