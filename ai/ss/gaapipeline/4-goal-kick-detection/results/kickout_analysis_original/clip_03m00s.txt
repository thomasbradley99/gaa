ANALYSIS:
KICKOUT: NO
CONFIDENCE: 10
HALF: first_half
CLIP_TIME: 03:00

REASONING: The clip shows the immediate aftermath of a score (a point kicked over the bar at 00:03). While this event would trigger a kickout, the actual kickout sequence (goalkeeper placing the ball on the 20m line and kicking it) does not occur within this 15-second video clip. The video ends as players are resetting and jogging back up the field.
