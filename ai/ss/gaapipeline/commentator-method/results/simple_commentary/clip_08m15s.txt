COMMENTARY:
The players reset as the blue team's goalkeeper, in the yellow jersey, prepares for the kickout. At 3.0 seconds, he strikes the ball off the tee, launching it high and down the left side of the pitch. Players from both the red and blue teams move to contest the ball as it hangs in the air.
