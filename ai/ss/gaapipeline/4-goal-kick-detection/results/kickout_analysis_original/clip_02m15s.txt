ANALYSIS:
KICKOUT: NO
CONFIDENCE: 10
HALF: first_half
CLIP_TIME: 02:15

REASONING: The clip shows continuous open play in the midfield area, which results in a stoppage for a foul. There is no trigger event for a kickout (such as a shot going wide or over the bar), nor is there any setup for one. The action does not involve the goalkeeper or the 20-meter line, and players do not spread out in a typical kickout formation. The stoppage is clearly for a free kick in the middle of the pitch.
