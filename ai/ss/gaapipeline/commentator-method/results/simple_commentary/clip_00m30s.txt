COMMENTARY:
Play resumes with the red and black team in possession on the right side of the field. The ball is kicked short towards the center, where players from both the red and black team and the blue and white team are jogging to get back into their defensive and attacking shapes. It's a slow build-up as they look to move the ball forward.
