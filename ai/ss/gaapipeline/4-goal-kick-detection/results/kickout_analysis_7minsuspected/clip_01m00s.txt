CONFIDENCE: 10
HALF: first_half
CLIP_TIME: 01:00
DETECTIONS: [player, ball, pitch, goalpost, crowd]
MISSED_DETECTIONS: [goalkeeper, referee]

REASONING: The clip begins with the ball already in the air, having been kicked from the midfield area by a player in a black and red jersey. This is not a kickout, as it is not taken by a goalkeeper from in front of their goal. The remainder of the clip shows continuous open play as both teams contest the ball and move it up the field. There is no stoppage of play or any of the required events in a kickout sequence.
