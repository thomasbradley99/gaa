ANALYSIS:
KICKOUT: NO
CONFIDENCE: 10
HALF: first_half
CLIP_TIME: 01:30

REASONING: The video clip shows continuous open play. A player from the team in blue jerseys kicks the ball over the crossbar for a point. The clip ends immediately after this score. While a score like this would trigger a kickout, the actual kickout sequence (stoppage, players clearing the area, goalkeeper setting up, and the kick itself) does not happen within this clip. The entire clip consists of active play.
