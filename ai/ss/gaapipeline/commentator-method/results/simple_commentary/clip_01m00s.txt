COMMENTARY:
The red team player in the number 9 jersey kicks the ball high towards the forward line. It drops into a congested area where a red player slips, allowing the blue team's number 10 to gather the breaking ball. He carries it out of defence with purpose, looking to launch a counter-attack for the team in blue and white jerseys.
