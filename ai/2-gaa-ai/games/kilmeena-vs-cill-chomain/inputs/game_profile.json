  "notes": "Team B's jersey color is generalized as 'Dark jerseys' to encompass variations like Black, Dark Blue, and Dark Blue/Black seen throughout the match. Team A's keeper color is listed as 'White keeper' based on explicit mentions, although this is not a distinct color from their field jerseys. Team B's keeper color is identified as 'Yellow keeper' as it is the most frequently mentioned distinct keeper color for the opposing team. There is a significant 'WARMUP' period after halftime (2130s-2730s) featuring 'Lime Green' jerseys, but subsequent 'IN-PLAY' frames revert to 'White vs Dark/Black' matchups, so the primary team colors are maintained.",
