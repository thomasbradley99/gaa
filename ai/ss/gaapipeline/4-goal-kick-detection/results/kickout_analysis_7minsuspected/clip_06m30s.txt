REASONING: The clip shows a period of continuous open play. At 00:05, an outfield player in a blue and white jersey makes a long kick from the right side of the pitch towards the opponent's goal. This action is a pass or a shot attempt during play, not a formal restart by a goalkeeper from the 20-meter line. No goalkeeper is seen taking the kick, and the player positioning is consistent with open play rather than a set-piece kickout.
