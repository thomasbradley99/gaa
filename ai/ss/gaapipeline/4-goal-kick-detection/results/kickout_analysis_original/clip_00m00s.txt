KICKOUT: NO
CONFIDENCE: 10

CLIP_TIME: 00:00

REASONING: The video shows two teams warming up on the pitch before a match. There are multiple footballs in play, and players are casually jogging and kicking them around. This is not official match play, and therefore, no official kickout can occur. None of the criteria for a kickout, such as a trigger event or a structured restart, are met.
