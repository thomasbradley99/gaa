COMMENTARY:
The red team is set to restart the game with a kickout. The goalkeeper, in a yellow jersey, steps up to take it. At 6.1 seconds, he makes contact, driving a low kick out towards the left wing of the field. Players from both the red and blue teams race towards the ball as it bounces, looking to gain possession.
