ANALYSIS:
KICKOUT: NO
CONFIDENCE: 10
HALF: first_half
CLIP_TIME: 02:30
DETECTIONS: [Player, Ball, Pitch, Goalpost]
MISSED_DETECTIONS: [Goalkeeper, Referee]
REASONING: The clip shows a continuous period of open play. The ball is being passed between players in the midfield as one team attempts to build an attack. There is no evidence of a stoppage in play or a restart by a goalkeeper from their goal area, which is the defining characteristic of a kickout. The players are clustered around the ball, which is typical of open play, not the spread formation seen during a kickout.
