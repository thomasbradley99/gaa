COMMENTARY:
The red team sets up to restart play following a score from the blue team. The red team goalkeeper, in a yellow jersey, prepares for the kickout from the edge of the small rectangle. At 9.1 seconds, he strikes the ball, sending a short, low kick out towards his left-hand side. The ball is collected cleanly by his teammate, who looks to start the next attack from deep.
