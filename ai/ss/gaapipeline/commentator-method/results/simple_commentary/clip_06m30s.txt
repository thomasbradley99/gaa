COMMENTARY:
A player in a blue and white jersey launches a long, high kick from midfield, sending it deep into the opposition's half. The ball bounces high near the 20-meter line, creating a footrace between an attacking blue player and a defending red and black player. The play develops quickly towards the red team's goal as they both chase the loose ball.
