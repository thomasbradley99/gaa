TACTICAL_CONTEXT: This is a classic long, central kickout from the goalkeeper of the red and black team. The objective is to bypass any potential high press and create a 50/50 aerial contest in the middle third of the field. Although the initial aerial contest is not won cleanly, the kicking team effectively floods the landing zone and successfully wins the breaking ball, allowing them to retain possession and launch an attack from a strong midfield position.
