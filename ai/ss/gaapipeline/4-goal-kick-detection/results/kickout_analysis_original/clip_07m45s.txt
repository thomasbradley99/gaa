ANALYSIS:
KICKOUT: NO
CONFIDENCE: 10
HALF: first_half
CLIP_TIME: 07:45

REASONING: The clip begins with the ball already in the air and descending in the middle of the field. There is no preceding trigger event visible (such as a shot going wide or over the bar). The action is continuous play, not a formal restart from a complete stoppage. A player catches the ball from the air and is immediately tackled, with the referee blowing the whistle for a foul. This is a sequence of open play, not a structured kickout from the 20-meter line.
