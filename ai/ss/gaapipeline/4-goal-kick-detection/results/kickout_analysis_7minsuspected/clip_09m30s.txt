ANALYSIS:
KICKOUT: NO
CONFIDENCE: 10
HALF: first_half
CLIP_TIME: 09:30
DETECTIONS: [player, ball, pitch, goalpost, crowd]
MISSED_DETECTIONS: [goalkeeper, referee]

REASONING: The clip shows continuous open play. A player from the blue team kicks the ball forward as part of an attack towards the opposition's goal. This is a pass during play, not a restart taken by a goalkeeper. There is no evidence of the ball going out of play, a referee signaling, or a goalkeeper setting up for a kickout. Players are clustered around the action, which is inconsistent with the typical spreading out seen during a kickout.
