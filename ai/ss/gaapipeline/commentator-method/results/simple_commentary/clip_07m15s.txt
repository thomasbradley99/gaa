COMMENTARY:
The team in red and black jerseys builds an attack from the middle of the park, working the ball forward with a long, diagonal kick pass. It's a great delivery into the forward line, finding a teammate who takes the mark. He quickly turns and slots it straight over the bar for an excellent point.
