REASONING: The clip shows a period of open play where the team in blue jerseys attacks the goal on the left side of the screen. A player kicks the ball, and it appears to go over the crossbar for a point. This event would typically trigger a kickout. However, the clip ends immediately after the score, before the play is restarted. The actual sequence of the goalkeeper taking the kickout is not shown.
