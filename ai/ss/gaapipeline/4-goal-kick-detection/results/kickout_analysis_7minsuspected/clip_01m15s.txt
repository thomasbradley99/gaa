ANALYSIS:
KICKOUT: NO
CONFIDENCE: 10
HALF: first_half
CLIP_TIME: 01:15
DETECTIONS: [player, ball, grass, referee]
MISSED_DETECTIONS: [goalpost, goalkeeper]

REASONING: The clip shows continuous open play in the middle of the field. There is no stoppage for a score or a wide. The play is eventually halted by the referee's whistle at 00:12 for a foul during a tackle. The action is not near a goalpost, and a goalkeeper is not involved in restarting play. Therefore, this is a free kick, not an official kickout.
