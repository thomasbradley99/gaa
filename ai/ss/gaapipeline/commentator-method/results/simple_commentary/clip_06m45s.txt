COMMENTARY:
The red team's goalkeeper takes the kickout, striking the ball at 0.9 seconds and sending it high towards the right wing. A player in a blue and white jersey rises to claim it cleanly, launching an attack for his side. The blue team now patiently works the ball across the middle of the pitch, probing for an opening against the red and black jerseys.
