ANALYSIS:
KICKOUT: NO
CONFIDENCE: 10
HALF: first_half
CLIP_TIME: 02:45

REASONING: The clip shows a continuous phase of open play in the midfield. There is no stoppage in play, nor is there a trigger event (such as a shot going wide or over the bar) that would necessitate a kickout. The ball is being actively passed between players, and a goalkeeper is not preparing for or taking a kick from the 20-meter line. This is simply standard match play.
