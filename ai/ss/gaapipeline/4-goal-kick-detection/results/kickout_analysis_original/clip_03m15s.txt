ANALYSIS:
KICKOUT: NO
CONFIDENCE: 10
HALF: first_half
CLIP_TIME: 03:15

REASONING: The clip shows a point being scored, which is a valid trigger for a kickout. However, the subsequent action is not a kickout. The camera pans away and the game continues without any of the mandatory kickout procedures being shown. There is no stoppage where players clear the 20-meter area, no goalkeeper placing the ball on the ground, and no structured kick from the 20-meter line. The play shown after the score is continuous midfield action, not a restart from a kickout.
