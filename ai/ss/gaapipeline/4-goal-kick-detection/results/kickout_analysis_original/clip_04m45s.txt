ANALYSIS:
KICKOUT: NO
CONFIDENCE: 10
HALF: first_half
CLIP_TIME: 04:45

REASONING: The clip shows a shot going wide of the goal at approximately 00:05, which is the trigger event for a potential kickout. However, the clip ends immediately after the ball goes out of play. The subsequent mandatory actions for an official kickout – such as a complete stoppage, players clearing the 20m area, the goalkeeper placing the ball on the ground, and taking the kick – are not shown. The kickout itself does not occur within this 15-second segment.
