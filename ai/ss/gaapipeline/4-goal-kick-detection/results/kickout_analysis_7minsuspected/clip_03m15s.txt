CLIP_TIME: 03:15
DETECTIONS: ['player', 'ball', 'goalpost', 'pitch', 'crowd']
MISSED_DETECTIONS: ['goalkeeper', 'referee']

REASONING: The clip shows a point being scored by the team in blue, which is confirmed by an official raising a white flag at the 00:07 mark. While a score is a trigger for a kickout, the actual kickout action (the goalkeeper kicking the ball to restart play) does not occur within this 15-second video. The clip ends as players are resetting their positions after the score, but before the goalkeeper takes the kick.
