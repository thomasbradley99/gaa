COMMENTARY:
The blue team attacks down the right flank, and their player gets a shot off under pressure from the red and black defender. It's a fantastic effort, sailing over the bar for a point, as the umpire raises the white flag at 7.5 seconds. Play will restart with a kickout from the red team's goalkeeper.
