REASONING: The clip depicts a continuous phase of open play, specifically an attacking move towards the goal on the left side of the screen. The ball is passed into the scoring zone where multiple players from both teams converge to contest it. There is no stoppage in play or any action that indicates a restart. The goalkeeper is visible and is in a defensive position, reacting to the attack, rather than setting up for and taking a kickout. The criteria for a kickout, such as players spreading out from the goal and a goalkeeper kicking from a dead-ball situation, are not met.
