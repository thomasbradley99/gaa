CONFIDENCE: 10

CLIP_TIME: 00:30

REASONING: The clip shows general play and players moving into position for a restart. There is no trigger event (such as a shot going wide or over the bar) shown in the clip. The play does not involve a goalkeeper placing the ball on the 20-meter line and taking a kick from the ground. Instead, the clip ends as players are still getting into position, and no kick that resembles a formal GAA kickout takes place.
