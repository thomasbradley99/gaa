COMMENTARY:
A player in a blue and white jersey drives towards the goal but is dispossessed by a strong tackle from the red and black defender. The ball spills loose, and after a frantic scramble on the ground, the blue team manages to dig it out. The ball is kicked high and claimed by a blue player, who quickly handpasses it to a teammate running into space.
