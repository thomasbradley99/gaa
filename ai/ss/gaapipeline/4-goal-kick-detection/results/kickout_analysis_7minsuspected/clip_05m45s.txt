ANALYSIS:
KICKOUT: NO
CONFIDENCE: 10
HALF: first_half
CLIP_TIME: 05:45
DETECTIONS: [player, goalkeeper, ball, goalpost, pitch]
MISSED_DETECTIONS: [referee]

REASONING: The video shows the complete setup for a kickout. The goalkeeper is in position near the goal, has placed the ball on the ground, and the outfield players are spread across the pitch in anticipation. However, the 15-second clip ends as the goalkeeper begins their run-up, before any contact is made with the ball. Since the kick itself is the essential action and it does not occur within the provided footage, a kickout cannot be confirmed.
