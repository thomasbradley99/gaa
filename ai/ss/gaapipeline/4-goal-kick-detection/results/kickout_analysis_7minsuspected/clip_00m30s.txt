ANALYSIS:
KICKOUT: NO
CONFIDENCE: 10
HALF: first_half
CLIP_TIME: 00:30
DETECTIONS: [player, pitch, crowd]
MISSED_DETECTIONS: [ball, goalkeeper, goalpost, referee]

REASONING: The clip shows a period of open play in the middle of the field. The players are jogging and repositioning, but there is no indication of a stoppage in play or a restart. The defining action of a kickout, which is a goalkeeper kicking the ball from near their own goal, does not occur. The play is concentrated in the central third of the pitch, far from either goalpost.
