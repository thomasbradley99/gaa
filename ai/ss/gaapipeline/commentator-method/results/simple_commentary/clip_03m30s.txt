COMMENTARY:
And that's a lovely point for the blue and white team, sailing over the bar from distance. The umpire confirms the score with the white flag. The red team's goalkeeper in the black and red jersey prepares for the restart, and at 7.7 seconds, he strikes the kickout, sending it high towards midfield for the players to contest.
