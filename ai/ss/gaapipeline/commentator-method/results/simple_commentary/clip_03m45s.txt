COMMENTARY:
Play is reset with the team in red and black in possession around the center of the field. A player looks up and at 11.8 seconds, launches a long, high ball in towards the goal. Players from both the red and black and blue and white teams gather underneath it, anticipating the break as the ball drops into the scoring zone.
