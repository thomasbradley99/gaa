COMMENTARY:
The team in blue and white jerseys builds an attack, moving the ball through the hands up the right flank. The player in possession is put under pressure but manages to get a kick away, sending a high, diagonal ball across the field. A teammate in space on the far wing runs onto it to continue the offensive drive.
