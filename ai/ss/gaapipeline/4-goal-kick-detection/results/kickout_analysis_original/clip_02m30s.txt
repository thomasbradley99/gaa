ANALYSIS:
KICKOUT: NO
CONFIDENCE: 10
HALF: first_half
CLIP_TIME: 02:30

REASONING: The video shows a continuous period of active play. There is no trigger event (like a shot going wide) that would lead to a kickout. Play never stops, the goalkeeper does not place the ball on the ground for a restart, and all actions are part of the general flow of the game. This is a standard passage of play, not a set-piece kickout.
