COMMENTARY:
The blue team works the ball forward, and a shot on goal from the right side drifts wide of the post. The red team goalkeeper in black and red quickly resets, and at 12.7 seconds, he strikes the ball, driving it out towards the left wing. Possession is won cleanly in the air by a player in blue and white, who is immediately put under pressure as he looks to launch another attack.
