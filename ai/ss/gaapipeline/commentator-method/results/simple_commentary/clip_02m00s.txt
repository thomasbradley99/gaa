COMMENTARY:
The player in the blue and white jersey carries the ball forward with purpose, drawing in a defender before hand-passing to his teammate. The blue team patiently works the ball across the field, probing the red and black team's defensive line. They continue to maintain possession, looking for an opening to attack the posts.
