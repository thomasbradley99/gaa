ANALYSIS:
KICKOUT: NO
CONFIDENCE: 10
HALF: first_half
CLIP_TIME: 04:30

REASONING: The video shows continuous open play in the midfield. There is no stoppage of play, no trigger event (like a shot going wide), and no structured restart from the 20-meter line by a goalkeeper. The ball is passed and kicked as part of the normal flow of the game. This does not meet any of the criteria for an official GAA kickout.
