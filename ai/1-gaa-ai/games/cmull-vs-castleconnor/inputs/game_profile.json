  "notes": "Team A's jersey color is a consolidation of 'Red', 'Red/White', 'Red/Orange', 'Red/Black', and 'Orange' variants, with 'Red/White' being the most representative. Team B's jersey color is a consolidation of 'Blue', 'White', 'Blue/White', 'White/Blue', 'Light Blue/White', 'White/Dark Blue', 'White/Light Blue', 'White/Dark', and 'White/Black' variants, with 'White/Blue' being the most representative. Team A's keeper color 'Black' was chosen due to its specific and frequent mention when visible. Team B's keeper color 'Dark' was chosen due to high inconsistency and frequent 'not visible' mentions, with 'Dark' being a common general description when visible. The halftime break duration is 4 minutes (240 seconds), which is slightly shorter than the typical 5-15 minutes for GAA but represents the clearest and most sustained break in active match play.",
