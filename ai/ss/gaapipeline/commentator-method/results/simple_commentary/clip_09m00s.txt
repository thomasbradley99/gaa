COMMENTARY:
A long, speculative kick from a blue and white-shirted player sends the ball high and deep down the right flank. It travels a long distance, bouncing inside the red team's defensive third. A blue player gives chase, but it appears a red and black defender is positioned to get to the ball first near the sideline.
