DETECTIONS: ['grass', 'football player', 'football player', 'football player', 'football player', 'football player', 'white goal frame', 'football goal', 'football goal', 'football goal', 'goalkeeper', 'player', 'white round ball']
MISSED_DETECTIONS: ['referee']
REASONING:The players are running around in the midfield, and the ball is being passed around between them. This does not seem like the kickout sequence. The goalkeeper is not holding the ball, but it is on the ground.
