COMMENTARY:
The red and black team is on the attack, but the ball is spilled to the ground. A player in blue and white makes a strong tackle, forcing a scramble for the loose ball. The referee blows the whistle and awards a free kick to the team in blue and white for an illegal challenge by the red and black player.
