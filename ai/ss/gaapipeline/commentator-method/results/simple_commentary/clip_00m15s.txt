COMMENTARY:
Players from the red and blue teams begin to organize themselves across the midfield in anticipation of the restart. The blue team's goalkeeper, in the yellow jersey, places the ball and prepares for the kickout. At 4.0 seconds, he strikes the ball, driving it low towards the center of the field where players from both sides are positioned to contest for possession.
