ANALYSIS:
KICKOUT: NO
CONFIDENCE: 10
HALF: first_half
CLIP_TIME: 00:45
DETECTIONS: [player, pitch, crowd, dugout]
MISSED_DETECTIONS: [ball, goalpost, goalkeeper, referee]

REASONING: The clip shows players from both teams standing in the midfield area during a break in play. There is no goalkeeper or goalpost visible in the frame. The defining action of a kickout, which is the goalkeeper kicking the ball from near their goal, does not occur. The players are not repositioning themselves after a score or a wide ball; they appear to be waiting for play to resume from the middle of the pitch.
