ANALYSIS:
KICKOUT: NO
CONFIDENCE: 10
HALF: first_half
CLIP_TIME: 03:30

REASONING: This is not a kickout. The clip shows a free kick being taken. A whistle blows to stop play around 00:04, after which a player in a blue jersey takes a shot from his hands. This is characteristic of a free kick, not a kickout, which must be taken by the goalkeeper from the ground on the 20-meter line after a structured setup.
