MISSED_DETECTIONS: ['referee']

REASONING: The clip shows players from both teams standing around in the defensive half of the pitch near a goal. While the setup might resemble the moments before a kickout, with the goalkeeper present near the goal, no actual kickout occurs within the 15-second duration. The players are walking casually, and there is no attempt by the goalkeeper to place the ball and perform a kick to restart play. The overall lack of action and urgency indicates a break in play rather than an official kickout.
