ANALYSIS:
KICKOUT: NO
CONFIDENCE: 10
HALF: first_half
CLIP_TIME: 04:15

REASONING: The video shows continuous open play. There is no stoppage of play, no referee signal, and no structured setup for a restart. The ball is being passed between players in the middle of the field. This is not a kickout from the 20-meter line.
