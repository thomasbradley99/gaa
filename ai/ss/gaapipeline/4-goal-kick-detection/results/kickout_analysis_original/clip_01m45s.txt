ANALYSIS:
KICKOUT: NO
CONFIDENCE: 10
HALF: first_half
CLIP_TIME: 01:45

REASONING: The clip shows a continuous period of open play. There is no stoppage, no trigger event (like a shot going wide), and no goalkeeper setting up for a kick from the 20-meter line. The ball is passed between players as part of normal gameplay. This does not meet any of the criteria for an official GAA kickout.
