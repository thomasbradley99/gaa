MISSED_DETECTIONS: []
REASONING:The clip shows a continuation of general gameplay across the field with many players around. I do not observe any goalkeepers with the ball preparing for a kickout and I do not see a recent point or goal. I do not observe the referee signaling a kickout. All these observations lead me to confidently classify this clip as not a kickout.
