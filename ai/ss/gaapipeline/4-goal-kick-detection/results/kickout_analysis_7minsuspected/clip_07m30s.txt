ANALYSIS:
KICKOUT: NO
CONFIDENCE: 10
HALF: first_half
CLIP_TIME: 07:30
DETECTIONS: ['Player', 'Ball', 'Goalpost', 'Pitch', 'Goalkeeper']
MISSED_DETECTIONS: ['Referee']

REASONING: The clip depicts a continuous phase of open play. The ball is passed between players in the middle third of the pitch and is never in the possession of a goalkeeper for a restart. The action does not originate from near a goalpost, and players are actively competing for the ball rather than setting up for a kickout. A high kick is made by a player, not a goalkeeper, and the play continues from there.
