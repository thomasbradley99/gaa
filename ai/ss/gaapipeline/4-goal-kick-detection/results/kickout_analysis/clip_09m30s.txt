HALF: first_half
TIMESTAMP: 09:30
CLIP_FILE: clip_09m30s.mp4
ANALYSIS:
Okay, I will analyze the 15-second clip to determine if a kickout occurred, following the instructions and format provided.

KICKOUT: NO
CONFIDENCE: 10
HALF: first_half
CLIP_TIME: 09:30
DETECTIONS: [player, grass green grass field, ball, white goal frame, football player goalkeeper, referee, football goal, netted goal]
MISSED_DETECTIONS: []
REASONING: The clip shows a standard play sequence with both teams in the middle of the field. The goalkeepers are at each end of the field, but there's no indication that the ball has just gone out of play or that a kickout is about to occur. There's no whistle from the referee nor is there any obvious change in positioning of the players that would be expected prior to a kickout.
