KICKOUT: NO
CONFIDENCE: 10
HALF: first_half
CLIP_TIME: 07:00

REASONING: The video clip shows continuous, open play. Players are actively passing the ball and moving towards the goal. A shot is taken, but the clip does not show any of the mandatory phases of an official kickout, such as a complete stoppage of play, players clearing the 20-meter area, or a goalkeeper setting up and kicking the ball from the ground. The entire sequence is simply live match action.
