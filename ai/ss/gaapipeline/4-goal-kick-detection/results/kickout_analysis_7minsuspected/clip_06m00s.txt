The kick is strategically aimed towards the center of the pitch to create a 50/50 aerial battle in the midfield. Players from both Team A (red/black) and Team B (blue) converge on the landing zone. The ball is not won cleanly in the air, leading to a contested break on the ground where multiple players immediately engage in a tackle to secure possession.
