ANALYSIS:
KICKOUT: NO
CONFIDENCE: 10
HALF: first_half
CLIP_TIME: 09:30

REASONING: The clip shows a period of active play where a team in blue and white jerseys attacks. A player kicks the ball towards the goal, and it goes wide of the posts. While this action (a wide shot) is a trigger for a kickout, the actual kickout event itself is not shown in the video. The clip ends immediately after the ball goes out of play, without showing the subsequent stoppage, setup, or the goalkeeper taking the kick from the 20-meter line. Therefore, a kickout has not occurred within this clip.
