GROUND TRUTH WORKFLOW
=====================

This directory contains professional ground truth annotations from Anadi Pro.

SOURCE FILES:
-------------
• ground_truth_full_anadi.xml
  - Full Anadi Pro XML export with ALL event types:
    * Shot Own/Opp
    * Kickout Own/Opp
    * Turnover Won/Lost
    * Foul Awarded/Conceded
    * Possession Own/Opp (not detectable by AI)
    * Attack Own/OPP (not detectable by AI)
    * Ball in Play / Stoppage (not detectable by AI)
    * Hot Ball, Highlight, Referee, etc. (metadata)
  
  - This is the SOURCE OF TRUTH - never delete or modify

CONVERSION WORKFLOW:
-------------------
1. Export full match annotations from Anadi Pro → ground_truth_full_anadi.xml

2. Convert to web schema (detectable events only):
   
   # Full match (all detectable events)
   $ cd pipelines/1-production
   $ python3 anadi_to_web_schema.py \
       --game kilmeena-vs-cill-chomain \
       --input ground_truth_full_anadi.xml
   
   # First 10 minutes only (for evaluation)
   $ python3 anadi_to_web_schema.py \
       --game kilmeena-vs-cill-chomain \
       --input ground_truth_full_anadi.xml \
       --output ../../games/kilmeena-vs-cill-chomain/inputs/web_schema_first_10min.json \
       --time-limit 600

3. Outputs:
   • web_schema.json - Full match (134 events)
   • web_schema_first_10min.json - First 10 min (20 events)
   
   Format: EVENT_SCHEMA.ts compatible JSON
   Used by: evaluation pipeline (7_evaluate.py), web viewer

DETECTABLE EVENTS:
-----------------
Only these event types can be detected by AI from video:
  ✓ Shot (Own/Opp) → Point/Wide/Goal/Saved
  ✓ Kickout (Own/Opp) → Won/Lost (Long/Mid/Short, Left/Centre/Right)
  ✓ Turnover (Won/Lost) → Forced/Unforced, with zone
  ✓ Foul (Awarded/Conceded) → Scoreable flag

Non-detectable (filtered out):
  ✗ Possession phases
  ✗ Attack phases
  ✗ Ball in play / Stoppage states
  ✗ Positional tracking

WHY THIS APPROACH?
-----------------
• Anadi Pro XML is the professional standard with rich metadata
• Keep full XML as source for future analysis/queries
• Conversion script filters to AI-detectable subset
• Web schema JSON is optimized for evaluation & web viewer
• Single source of truth, multiple derived outputs

STATISTICS (Kilmeena vs Cill Chomain):
--------------------------------------
Full Anadi XML: 486 total events
  → 134 detectable events (Shot, Kickout, Turnover, Foul)
  → 352 non-detectable filtered out (Possession, Attack, etc.)

Match duration: ~82 minutes

First 10 minutes (0-600s):
  → 20 detectable events
  → Breakdown: 6 Shots, 5 Kickouts, 5 Fouls, 2 Turnovers, 2 Throw-ups
  → Time range: 26.8s - 566.2s (9.4 min)
