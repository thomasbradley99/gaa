ANALYSIS:
KICKOUT: NO
CONFIDENCE: 10
HALF: first_half
CLIP_TIME: 06:15
DETECTIONS: [player, ball, goalpost, pitch, crowd]
MISSED_DETECTIONS: [goalkeeper, referee]

REASONING: The clip shows a period of open play culminating in a point being scored. A player from the team in blue jerseys kicks the ball over the crossbar. This action is what *causes* a kickout to be awarded, but the actual kickout by the goalkeeper to restart play does not occur within this 15-second clip. The video ends as the players begin to reset their positions following the score.
