ANALYSIS:
KICKOUT: NO
CONFIDENCE: 10
HALF: first_half
CLIP_TIME: 09:00

REASONING: The clip shows a player kicking the ball from their hands during open play. There is no stoppage of play, the ball is not placed on the ground at the 20-meter line, and the trigger event (a shot going wide or over) is not visible. This is a standard long pass or clearance during the normal flow of the game, not an official kickout.
