ANALYSIS:
KICKOUT: NO
CONFIDENCE: 10
HALF: first_half
CLIP_TIME: 08:00

REASONING: The clip shows a period of active play around the goal, not a kickout. The play begins with a shot attempt by the blue team, which is contested. The referee then blows the whistle at approximately 00:07 for a foul during the scramble for the ball. The players do not clear the 20m area, nor does a goalkeeper place the ball on the ground for a structured kick. This is a stoppage for a free kick, not a kickout.
