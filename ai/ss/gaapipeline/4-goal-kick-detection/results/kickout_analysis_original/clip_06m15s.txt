ANALYSIS:
KICKOUT: NO
CONFIDENCE: 10
HALF: first_half
CLIP_TIME: 06:15

REASONING: The clip shows continuous open play in the midfield. There is no trigger event (like a shot going wide) causing a stoppage of play. The ball is not kicked by a goalkeeper from the 20-meter line. Instead, we see players tackling, passing, and running with the ball as part of normal match play. The mandatory sequence for an official kickout is entirely absent.
